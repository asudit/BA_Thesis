\Large Bank Distress and Unemployment During the Great Depression:\\ A Plant-Level Approach \vskip-.2cm}

\maketitle

\section{Introduction}
\indent It is no secret that the Great Depression had devastating effects on real economic activity. What is less clear is through what mechanisms the financial crisis affected the economy. Friedman and Schwartz (1963) posited that monetary channels, and in particular decreased money supply, played an important role in the severity of the Great Depression.  
\\
\indent \href{https://www.jstor.org/stable/1808111?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents}{Bernanke (1983)} redefined the economic literature by showing that while monetary channels are important to establishing a causal connection between financial crisis (specifically bank distress) and economic activity, non-monetary channels have a significant role to play as well. His key idea is that of the cost of intermediation in incomplete markets; as the transaction costs inherent to an incomplete market like bank lending increase in the wake of financial panic, the acquisition of credit become prohibitively expensive.
\\
\indent How financing constraints firms and households face during times of economic crisis influence their well-being has been of considerable interest to researchers. \href{http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/46105816/monetarypolicy.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&Expires=1492524569&Signature=aBXzQ2UvFRKnToeBPvx8tGucLXk%3D&response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DMonetary_Policy_and_Credit_Conditions_Ev.pdf}{Kashyap et. al} show that lending constraints affect firm investment. \href{https://www.jstor.org/stable/2109844?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents}{Bernanke, Gertler, and Gilchrist} further develop the theory with the idea of a financial accelerator, in which relatively small shocks to the economy can be exacerbated by the market for credit. They show that when borrowers cannot obtain external financing in the wake of one of these shocks, they experience decreases in output.
\\
\indent One body of literature has used natural experiments to identify exogenous shocks to lending channels, one source of external finance. \href{https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.90.1.30}{Peek and Rosengren} measure the effect of a shock within the Japanese banking sector on commercial real estate markets within the United States. \href{https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/000282805775014326}{Ashcraft} measures the effect of small bank closures on local economic outcomes in Texas by using FDIC measures on a state level as an exogenous source of bank failure on the local level. More recently, \href{https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.98.4.1413}{Khwaja and Mian} employ a new empirical strategy isolate loan supply effects from loan demand effects on the firm level by exploiting variation in bank exposure to liquidity shocks across banks lending to the same firm. They find that a firm's ability to obtain loans from alternative sources in the wake of a liquidity shock affects the extent to which a firm subsequently declines, and that smaller firms are therefore worse off than larger firms in the wake a liquidity shock.
\\
\indent The effects of restricted financing opportunities on firm employment has also been studied. Among others, \href{https://scholar.harvard.edu/chodorow-reich/publications/employment-effects-credit-market-disruptions-firm-level-evidence-2008-09}{Chodorow-Reich} finds that the ability of a firm to obtain credit in the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brothers directly influenced uemployment outcomes within those firms. Firms that had access to credit from healthier lenders before the collapse did not lay off as many employees, relative to firms with access to credit from less financially stable lenders.
\\
\indent There has also been a resurgence of papers on the Great Depression. The dearth of data on direct loan channels between banks and firms has led to a series of novel approaches. \href{https://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty/ccalomiris/papers/Consequences%20of%20U.S.%20Bank%20Distress%20During%20the%20Depression.pdf}{Calomiris and Mason} reinvigorated the literature by using a variety of instruments for state-level bank loan supply and show that bank distress had a significant effect on changes in state income. \href{http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/mac.5.1.81}{Ziebarth} uses variation in Federal policy across different districts of Mississippi to study the effect of bank distress on firm revenue. In a working paper, \href{http://www.nber.org/papers/w23216.pdf}{Benmelech et. al} use variation in the maturity dates of corporate bonds that firms held during the Great Depression as a proxy for credit supply. \href{http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/mezzanotti/documents/lee_mezzanotti_greatdepression.pdf}{Lee and Mezzanotti}, and \href{http://www.people.hbs.edu/tnicholas/bank_distress.pdf}{Nanda and Nicholas} use firm-level manufacturing data to study firm level employment and patent outcomes, respectively.
\\
\indent This paper seeks to constribute the recent body of literature by using plant-level data from the Census of Manufacturers\footnote{Nicolas Ziebarth and Chris Vickers generously shared these data with me} across a variety of industries to take a new look at the effects of bank distress on employment outcomes during the Great Depression.

\section{Historical Background}
In order to justify certain assumptions in the model, it is important to briefly discuss the historical background of the period.
\subsection{The Great Depression}
\indent The Great Depression began with the stock market crash of October 1929; what initially began as a stable decline in the S\&P Stock Index culminated with a financial panic on October 29, in which investors began trading and selling securities at great volume. The panic was by no means restricted to the financial sector. By the time October of the following year arrived, income, prices, and production had fallen 16, 14, and 26 percent respectively. Still, up to that point, there had only been a 2 percent decrease in bank deposits; the banking sector was relatively untouched by declining economy. That changed after November 1930, when a series of bank failures in different states led to widespread bank runs throughout the rest of the country. (Freidman and Schwartz, 9-12). This in turn led to fire sales on the part of banks: the end of 1930 say a marked increase in corporate bond yields and a steady decline government bond yields, which might have implied that banks were selling off illiquid assets to keep up with depositor demand, while flying to safer and more liquid government bonds. 
\\
\indent In the absence of active intervention by the Federal Reserve System, a second banking crisis occurred in March 1931. Consumers began again to rapidly withdraw their deposits, while banks continued to sell off corporate bonds and fly to government bonds in response. Between February and August 1931, the deposits of commericial declined roughly 7 percent, or \$2.7 billion. (Freidman and Schwartz, 17-19). The detrimental effects on bank health of the sustained decrease in commercial bank deposits was compunded when Britain left the gold standard in Sepetember 1931. This lead foreign investors and entities to withdraw U.S. holdings in the form of gold from U.S. banks, which in turn further depleted U.S. bank reserves. Freidman and Schwartz note that between August 1931 and January 1932, ``1,860 banks with deposits of \$ 1.449 million suspended operations, and the deposits of those banks that managed to keep afloat fell by a much larger sum" (21). 
\\
\indent In order to counter the severe depletion of U.S bank balance sheets, the Federal Reserve started purchasing bonds on the open market at great volume in April 1932. The economic repreive proved to be temporary though, and more banks began to close in the end of 1932, into the beginning of 1933. This banking panic proved to be far more severe than before, partially because of the already weakened state of many banks, but also because of the degree to which bank reserves were futher depleted. By March 1933, many banks, along with the Federal Reserve System, temporarily closed down, unable to engage in any more transactions. The worst of the banking crisis ended with President Roosevelt's declaration of a national banking holiday on March 6. (Freidman and Schwartz, 26-32). 
\\
\indent The sequence of events discussed at length in this section is directly relevant to my model. A key component of my model assumes that shocks to the banking system occurred after 1929. As Freidman and Schwartz emphasize, the two main banking crises occurred between 1930 and 1931. Therefore, introducing bank distress in 1930, as opposed to 1931 or 1932, is a reasoable assumption to make.

\subsection{The Structure of the U.S. Banking System}
Leading up to the Great Depression, the U.S. Banking System was highly fragmented between local, state-chartered banks, and national banks (known as the dual-banking system). Furthermore, interstate and within-state branching was uncommon and often non-existent \href{https://www.richmondfed.org/~/media/richmondfedorg/publications/research/economic_review/1990/pdf/er760601.pdf}{(Mengle, 1990)}. From 1836, when the charter of the Second Bank of the U.S. was not renewed, to the inception of the National Bank Act of 1863, any bank with a state charter could issue their own bank notes, provided it was backed by state bonds. Most of these banks were not incoporated in the national bank system. The bank notes these unincorporated banks issued were used as currency throughout the Untied States. For this reason, the period of 1836-1863 is often called the Free Banking Era \href{http://faculty.som.yale.edu/garygorton/documents/Pricingfreebankingnotes.pdf}{(Gorton, 1999)}. 
\\
\indent In an effort to force these independent state banks to enter the national banking system, a 10 percent tax was issued on all state bank notes in 1865. As a result the number of state banks, where state banks included all banks chartered by state law, declined to 247 by 1868. The period between the end of the Civil War and 1913 saw a resurgence in state banking and the dual banking system between local and national banks. State banks became depository institutions instead of issuing bank notes, and able to compete with national banks due to less stringent state banking laws, among other factors. For example, in many states, state banks faced substantially lower capital requirements than national banks  \href{https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/files/docs/historical/federal\%20reserve\%20history/frcom_br_gp_ch_banking/dual_banking_system_us.pdf}{(Federal Reserve, 1932)}.
\\
\indent Importantly, the new banking system created after the Civil War was almost completely made up of unit banks. The Currency Act of 1900 saw a marked increase in unit banks. As the number of unit banks continued to grow from 1900 to the 19020's, state branch banking occurred more often as well. Unit banks strongly opposed branch banks, due to the compeition they posed, and as result successfully lobbied for the ban of branch banking on the state and national level during the 1920's. The 1924 Supreme Court case \textit{First National in St. Louis v. State of Missouri} confirmed that national bank branching was illegal. \href{https://www.richmondfed.org/~/media/richmondfedorg/publications/research/economic_review/1990/pdf/er760601.pdf}{(Mengle, 1990)}. Even after national banks were allowed to create branches in the localities near their headquarters following the passage of The McFadden Act of 1927 (if branching was already legal in the given state), national bank branching within a single state remained significantly limited \href{https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/3875046.pdf}{(Mitchener, 2005)}.
\\
\indent This discussion of the history of U.S. Banking is intended to substantiate two key facts about U.S. banking in the years leading to the Great Depression. First of all, the banking system was highly fragmented and there were numerous banks on the state and local level under state law that competed with national banks. Therefore, the financing these banks provided to firms was most likely not negligible. Second, the abolition or restriction of bank branching across and within states meant that many banks were composed of a single office in a given county, and that bank-specific sources of distress were often isolated to the regional level. These facts will inform my identification strategy. Table 1 reports state branching laws for 1910 and 1929.

\section{Data and Summary Statistics}

\indent Firm-level measures of labor, revenue, and industry are from the U.S. Census of Manufacturers, for 1929, 1931, 1933, and 1935. Table 1 includes summary statistics for the census sample. Revenue is reported as total value added, which I adjust for inflation using the consumer price index. The labor measure is reported as the number of wage earners per month, which I then aggregate to create an annualized labor measure.
\\
\indent Data on bank suspensions, total number of banks, and deposits on the county level comes from the FDIC Data on Banks in the United States, available on the ICSPR. Tables 2 and 3 report number of bank suspensions and number of banks suspended as a percentage of total banks, respectively. In general, we see that bank suspensions rose sharply between 1929 and 1930, receeded in 1931, and then rose even further in 1932. As the tables also show, there was also significant variation by region of the United States.
\\
\indent Ideally, I would use county level loan data between specific banks and firms to identify the credit channel between banks and firms. Unfortunately, as far I know these data does not exist. Based on previous work in the literature\footnote{See \href{http://www.people.hbs.edu/tnicholas/bank_distress.pdf}{Nanda and Nicolas, 2014} and \href{http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/jglee/files/lee_mezzanotti_bank_distress_manufacturing_0.pdf}{Lee and Mezzanotti, 2014}.}, I construct the following county-level measure of bank distress:
\begin{align*}
BankDistress_c = \frac{\sum_{t=1930}^{1935} BankSuspensions_{c, t}} {Banks_{c, 1929}}\
\end{align*}
\indent In other words, this measure of bank distress is a fixed county characteristic, in which I normalize the sum of the number of banks suspended from 1930-1935 in a given county by the number of banks in the same county during 1929. I include bank suspensions in 1934 and 1935 to account for any residual effects on bank health from the height of the Great Depression, and to ensure the measure spans the entirety of the census data. The vast majority of bank suspensions occurred between 1930-1933, so including 1934 and 1935 would not lead to overstated results in any case. Figure 1 maps this measure of bank distress to all counties in the sample. The map illustrates the considerable geographic variation in the level of bank distress. The FDIC data is quite useful in painting a complete picture of bank distress across the United States because it has data on all banks, regardless of whether they were part of the Federal Reserve System or not. Conistent with the literature, I do not discriminate between bank suspensions and bank failures.

\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Fixed Effects}
I start with a fixed effects specification in order to control for county, industry, and time-specific shocks to manufacturing activity: 
\begin{align*}
log(L_{jt}) = \beta_{0t} + \beta_{1t} Post\_1929XBank\_Distress_c + \gamma_t + \mu_c +\eta_i  + \epsilon_{ct}
\end{align*}
\indent where $log(L_{jt})$ is log labor in period t for firm j, $Post\_1929$ is a indicator variable for whether the observation is after 1929,  and $\gamma_t$, $\mu_c$, and $\eta_i$ are year, county, and industry fixed effects, respectively. The indicator variable allows me to ``treat" the firms within my sample with shocks to local financing at the onset of the first Freidman-Schwartz banking crisis in October 1930. The effect of interest is therefore the interaction effects between $Post\_1929$ and the measure of bank distress. Because I am studying the effects of bank distress on firm employment decisions over time, I restrict my sample (as I will do for the rest of the paper) to firms that were open in 1929. Standard errors are clustered by county using heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors. 
\\
\indent Implicit in this empirical specification is the assumption that bank distress is contained to the county level. My discussion of the U.S. banking system provides evidence for this assumption. Restrictions on statewide branching, a national prohibition of interstate branching, and preponderence of small, unit banks meant that many banks were restricted to local operations. As a result of this considerable fragmentation, local, bank-specific shocks most likely did not spill over into other localities. 

\subsection{Instrumental Variables}
\indent A serious concern with the empirical specification in the previous section is one of reverse casuality. It is likely that banks were more likely to fail or suspend operations in counties with great disruptions in manufacturing activity. Among other things, distressed manufacturing firms were more likely to default on bank loans, causing bank balance sheet health to deteriorate. Since my identification strategy exploits geogrpahic variation in bank distress to identify the credit channel, indeed of explicitly identifying a firm's dependence on external finance, the directionality of bank distress to firm distress may be in question.
\\
\indent The economic history literature has dealt with this issue in a variety ways; one common method is to create an instrumental variable based on the proportion of a bank's assets tied to real estate. \href{https://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty/ccalomiris/papers/Consequences%20of%20U.S.%20Bank%20Distress%20During%20the%20Depression.pdf}{Calomiris and Mason} show that the proportion of a bank's assets in real estate is a robust loan-supply instrument. \href{http://eh.net/eha/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Mladjan.pdf}{Mladjan} uses changes in the value of farmland over the 1910's as an instrument for bank failures.
\\
\indent I use change in mortgage debt per acre from 1910 to 1920 (on the county level) as an instrument for bank distress, from \href{http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.20120525}{Rajan and Ramcharan, 2015}. During the 1910's, the United States enjoyed a surge in land prices due increased agricultural exports to Europe after the decimation of World War I left much of European farmland in ruin. This real estate bubble burst in 1920, causing national farm income to plummet\footnote{See Rajan and Ramcharan, 2015 for a more in-depth discussion of the historical background.}. As Rajan and Ramcharan show, change in mortgage debt per acre from 1920-1910 is a good predictor of bank suspensions between 1920-1929. Taking that logic one step further, banks in counties with increased mortgage debt per acre most likely had weaker balance sheets leading up to the Great Depression, since farmers experiencing a drop in income after 1920 found it difficult to pay back their mortgages. I employ a two stage least squares regression to instrument bank distress with change in mortgage debt. Below is the first stage:
\begin{align*}
Post\_1929XBank\_Distress_c = \beta_{0t} + \beta_{1t} \Delta Mortgage\_Debt + \gamma_t + \mu_c +\eta_i  + \epsilon_{ct}
\end{align*}
It should be noted that agricultural debt could be highly correlated with county-level shocks during the Great Depression, since farmers could conceivably be burdened by debt from 20 years before. Most instruments tied to land values have similar issues with the exclusion restriction.

\section{Estimation Results}
Tables 6 and 7 report estimation results for the fixed effects and instrumental variable specifications, respectively. Turning first to table 6, the negative sign of the interaction effects coefficient confirm that bank distress does indeed have a detrimental effect on employment at the firm level. A particularly interest result is that the statistical significance of bank distress on log labor vanishes when industry fixed effects are included. Furthermore, the R-squared value considerably improves when industry fixed effects are included. This may mean that industry-specific characteristics of a firm play an important role in determining a firm's hiring decisions.  
\\
\indent Turning to table 7, the statistically significant coefficient from the first stage regression indicates that change in mortgage debt is a strong instrument for bank distress, as predicted. Column 2 reports a large, statistically significant, and negative effect of instrumented bank distress on log labor. The greater statistical significance of the bank distress instrument may indicate it does not suffer as severely from reverse casuality as the original measure of bank distress in table 6. Overall, table 6 and 7 show that bank distress has a detrimental effect on employment.

\section{Variation in Dependence on External Finance}
\indent The results from the main specification suggest that industrys-specific characteristics have an important role to play in firm employment outcomes. My data does indicate that substantatial variation did exists in employment outcomes and revenue levels across the industries in the sample. As figures 2 and 3 show, more traditionally capital intensive firms with a greater degree of dependence on external finance in general experienced greater decreases in revenue and employment over the course of the Great Depression.
\\
In order to explore this further, and hopefully better explain my main results, I use measures of external financial dependence by industry from \href{http://www.people.hbs.edu/tnicholas/bank_distress.pdf}{Nanda and Nicholas}\footnote{These values are in turn from \href{https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/raghuram.rajan/research/papers/growth.pdf}{Rajan and Zingales, 1998}. More details can be found on table 9} to create a dummy variables for firms in industries with a high level of dependence on external finance, similar to the specification Nanda and Nicolas used. I then introduce the following specification to see if firms in industries with great dependence on external finance were more adversely affected by bank distress (bank distress being one form of external finance).
\begin{align*}
log(L_{jt}) = \beta_{0t} + \beta_{1t} Ext\_Fin\_Dependence_iXPost\_1929XBank\_Distress_c + \gamma_t + \mu_c +\eta_i  + \epsilon_{ct}
\end{align*}
Table 8 reports the results of this new specification. Row 1 reports the coefficient for the interaction effects between the measure of bank distress and the high external finance dependence dummy. There is a statistically significant and negative effect on log employment, which indicates that firms in industries with high dependence on external finance saw a decrease in employment. The very last figure demonstrates this visually.

Values are from Table A3 of Nanda and Nicholas (2014), which in turn are based on calaulcated values from Rajan and Zingales (1998), for mature companies. When an industry in the sample fell into multiple industry categories from Nanda and Nicholas, the average of those measures was used. Rajan and Zingales define a company's dependence on external finance to be its capital expenditures minus cash generated from operations, divided by total capital expenditures. They calculate the measure for both young and mature firms during the 1980's.}
